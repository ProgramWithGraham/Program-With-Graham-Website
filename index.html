        <h3>Virtual Pet Shelter</h3>
        <!-- screenshot and link to google -->
        <p>
          Virtual pet has been upgraded to include a shelter so that you can
          house and handle more than one pet at a time. You are tasked with
          maintain levels of Hunger,Thirst, and boredom for all pets in the
          shelter. There are now options to have your pets adopted (removed from
          the shelter), add new pets, and to play with a specific pet of your
          choice.

        <h3>Pets Amok</h3>
        <!-- screenshot and link to google -->
        <p>
          The next big phase of Virtual Pet Shelter. Pets Amok!! There are now
          more specific types of pets like Organic and Robo. Cats have been
          thrown into the mix as well. Not only do you have to pay attention to
          Hunger,Thirst and Boredom levels for each pet, now there new
          attributes added for each different type of pet. BE-CAREFUL, to not
          let your levels go to low otherwise your pet will lose happiness and
          even health. Can you keep up? Do you have what it takes to manage so
          many different pets?
