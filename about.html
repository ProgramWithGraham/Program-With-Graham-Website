    <p class="bio">
      Hello, I have over a decades worth of background in logistics and customer
      service. I am changing my career path, with the skills I learned from
      WeCanCodeIt, to step into the software development field. I enjoy
      utilizing my strong attention to detail and problem solving skills through
      different forms of coding and their associated programs. In my free time,
      I enjoy building furniture from scratch, solving home maintenance
      problems, video games, and collecting memorabilia.
